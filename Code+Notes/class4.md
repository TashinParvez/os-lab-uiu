## 📌 Arrays in Bash

```bash
myArray=("cat" "dog" "mouse" "frog") # Elements separated by space
myArray[10]="far"  # Adding element at index 10

# Current indices -> 0 1 2 3 10
```

Here’s what happens:

1. `myArray` initially has elements at indices `0,1,2,3`.
2. Assign a value to index `10`, skipping indices `4` through `9`.
3. Bash allows this, so the array becomes **sparse**:

✅ Key points about Bash sparse arrays:

- Indices **don’t need to be continuous**.
- Missing indices simply **don’t exist**; they are not automatically filled.

---

### 📌 Iterate Over Values Only / Array Print

```bash
for str in ${myArray[@]};  # @ => all values
do
  echo $str
done
```

- `${myArray[@]}` expands to **all the values** in the array.
- The `for` loop iterates **over each word/value** in the list provided.
- In the first iteration, `str="cat"`.
- In the second iteration, `str="dog"`, and so on.
- Simply prints the current value of `str`.
- So the output will be:
  ```
  cat
  dog
  mouse
  frog
  far
  ```

---

### 📌 Access Array Indices

```bash
for i in ${!myArray[@]};   # ! => access indices
do
  echo "Index $i has value ${myArray[$i]}"
done
```

- If you want to **see indices as well**, using `${myArray[@]}` won’t show the indices. Instead, you can use `${!myArray[@]}`

* The `!` before the array name tells Bash: **“Give me the indices of the array, not the values.”**

✅ Imp: `${myArray[$i]}`

- This accesses the **value stored at index `i`**.
- For example:
  - `${myArray[0]}` → `cat`
  - `${myArray[10]}` → `far`

* Output:

  ```
  Index 0 has value cat
  Index 1 has value dog
  Index 2 has value mouse
  Index 3 has value frog
  Index 10 has value far
  ```

✅ Key Takeaways:

1. `${!myArray[@]}` = **all indices**
2. `${myArray[$i]}` = **value at index \$i**

### 📌 Define the function

```bash
myFunction() {
    echo "Hello World OS lab"
}
```

- `myFunction()` declares a **function** named `myFunction`.
- The `{ ... }` block contains the commands that run when the function is called.

---

### 📌 Call the function

```bash
myFunction
```

- This executes the function you just defined.
- Output:

  ```
  Hello World OS lab
  ```

---

### 📌 Function with Arguments

---

```bash
add_two_num() {
    local sum=$(($1 + $2)) # exists only inside the function.
    echo "Sum of $1 and $2 is $sum"
}
```

1. `add_two_num()` declares a function named `add_two_num`.

2. `local sum=$(($1 + $2))`:

   - `$1` = first argument (`2`)
   - `$2` = second argument (`3`)
   - `$(($1 + $2))` = Bash arithmetic expansion → calculates `2 + 3 = 5`
   - `local` makes the variable `sum` **local to the function**, so it doesn’t affect variables outside the function.

3. `echo "Sum of $1 and $2 is $sum"` prints:

   ```
   Sum of 2 and 3 is 5
   ```

---

### 📌 Call the Function have Arguments

---

```bash
add_two_num 2 3
```

- `$1 = 2`, `$2 = 3`
- Output:

  ```
  Sum of 2 and 3 is 5
  ```

---

### 📌 Function Returning Integer (return a value from a function)

---

### ⏩Function definition

```bash
fun() {
    return 5
}
```

- `return 5` **does NOT return a value like in C/Python**.
- In Bash, `return` in a function sets the **exit status** of the function.
- Valid exit statuses are integers **0–255**.

  - `0` = success
  - Non-zero = usually indicates an error, but you can use it to return small numbers.

#### ⏩ Call the function

```bash
fun
```

- The function runs and sets the **return code** to `5`.

---

### ⏩ Access the return value

```bash
echo "Return value from function is: $?"
```

- `$?` always stores the **exit status of the last executed command** (or function).
- Output:

  ```
  Return value from function is: 5
  ```

or

```bash
result=$?
echo "Return value from function is: $result"
```

---

### ⏩ Use the return value

```bash
echo $((5 + $?))
```

- `$?` is still `5` (from the last function call).
- `5 + 5 = 10` → Output:

  ```
  10
  ```

---

### ✅ Key Points:

1. **Functions can be called before or after they are defined** in Bash, as long as they are defined in the same script.
2. `return` in Bash functions **only gives an integer exit status**, not general data.
3. `$?` is how you access the last command or function's return value.

---

## 📌 Variable Scope in Functions

```bash
var1="Apple"  # Global variable

myfun() {
    local var2="Banana"  # Local variable [exists only inside the function]
    var3="Cherry"        # Global variable
    echo "First fruit: $var1"
    echo "Second fruit: $var2"
}

myfun

echo "First fruit: $var1"
echo "Second fruit: $var2"  # Will not print (local)
echo "Third fruit: $var3"   # Will print (global)
```

---

## 📌 Returning Strings from Functions

```bash
function get_result() {
    local string="Hello, I am using Ubuntu. Returning from get_result()"
    echo $string  # Return string via stdout
}

# Store return value
result=$(get_result)
echo "$result"
```

# 🚨 Understanding `find` + `while read` in Bash

---

## 🚨 The `find` Command Basics

- `find` is used to **search for files and directories** in Linux.

- General syntax:

  ```bash
  find [path] [options] [expression]
  ```

Examples:

```bash
find . -name "notes.txt"      # Find file named notes.txt in current directory
find /home -type d            # Find only directories under /home
find . -type f -size +1M      # Find files larger than 1MB
```

---

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.txt" | while read -r file;
```

#### ✅ Key Takeaways

- `find` = command to search for files/directories, `-type d` → only directories.
- `.` = start searching in the **current directory**.
- `-type f` = only match **files** (ignore directories).
- `-name "*.txt"` = only match files ending with `.txt`. (Pattern)
- `| while read -r file` → process each result one by one in a loop.
- Inside loop, `$file` = filename found.

👉 Example: If your folder has:

```
./a.txt
./notes/b.txt
./test/data/c.txt
```

`find` will print all three paths, one per line.

---

### 🚨 `|` (pipe)

The **pipe** (`|`) takes the output of `find` and sends it into the next command.
So now every `.txt` filename will be fed line by line into the `while` loop.

---

### 🚨 `while read -r file; do ... done`

- `while ...; do ... done` = loop that keeps running for each input line.
- `read -r file` = reads **one line at a time** into the variable `file`.

  - `-r` prevents backslashes (`\`) from being treated as escapes.

- Inside the loop, `$file` contains the full path to the `.txt` file.

---

### Example in Action

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.txt" | while read -r file; do
    echo "Found: $file"
done
```

Output might be:

```
Found: ./a.txt
Found: ./notes/b.txt
Found: ./test/data/c.txt
```

---

---

## Example 1 – Print All `.txt` Files

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.txt" | while read -r file;
do
    echo "Found: $file"
done
```

📂 Suppose directory structure:

```
./a.txt
./docs/b.txt
./notes/c.txt
```

📜 Output:

```
Found: ./a.txt
Found: ./docs/b.txt
Found: ./notes/c.txt
```

---

## Example 2 – Count Lines in Each File

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.txt" | while read -r file;
do
    echo "$file has $(wc -l < "$file") lines"
done
```

📜 Output:

```
./a.txt has 10 lines
./docs/b.txt has 25 lines
./notes/c.txt has 7 lines
```

---

## Example 3 – Backup All `.txt` Files

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.txt" | while read -r file;
do
    cp "$file" "$file.bak"
    echo "Backup created: $file.bak"
done
```

📜 Output:

```
Backup created: ./a.txt.bak
Backup created: ./docs/b.txt.bak
Backup created: ./notes/c.txt.bak
```

---

## 🚨 Why use `find ... | while read` instead of `for file in *.txt`?

- `for file in *.txt` only matches files in **current directory** (not subfolders).
- `find ... | while read` works **recursively**, handling files in **all subdirectories**.
- It’s also safer with filenames containing spaces.

| **Sparse Array**                    | `myArray[10]="far"`                            | Non-continuous indices are allowed             | Missing indices are ignored                  |
| **Iterate over values**             | `for val in ${myArray[@]}; do echo $val; done` | Loops over all array values                    | `[@]` = all values                           |
| **Iterate over indices**            | `for i in ${!myArray[@]}; do echo $i; done`    | Loops over array indices                       | `!` gives indices, useful for sparse arrays  |
| **Function Definition**             | `myFunction() { echo "Hello"; }`               | Defines a reusable block of code               | Can be called anywhere in the script         |
| **Function Arguments**              | `myFunc() { echo $1 $2; }`                     | `$1`, `$2` refer to first and second arguments | Arguments are positional                     |
| **Local Variable**                  | `local var="value"`                            | Exists only inside the function                | Prevents overwriting global variables        |
| **Global Variable inside function** | `var="value"`                                  | Accessible inside & outside function           | Use carefully to avoid conflicts             |
| **Return integer**                  | `return 5`                                     | Sets exit status of function                   | Access with `$?` (0–255 only)                |
| **Capture return code**             | `result=$?`                                    | Stores last function/command exit code         | Must capture immediately after function call |
| **Return string**                   | `echo "Hello"`                                 | Prints value, captured with `result=$(func)`   | Use `local` for temp variables               |
| **Using captured string**           | `result=$(get_result); echo "$result"`         | Stores function output in variable             | Essential for string “return” in Bash        |
